<h3><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-wallet" id="what-is-a-wallet">What is a Wallet?</a></h3>
<p>A wallet is essentially a software that grants users access to the funds on blockchain using their private keys. You can use different wallets, but as long as you're using same private key - you would have access to the same funds on blockchain. Wallets in cardano ecosystem are of <em>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD)</em> and based on <em>UTXO</em> - and for good reasons. Before diving into these terms, lets ensure the basics about Private keys and its security is clarified.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#basics-about-private-keys" id="basics-about-private-keys">Basics about Private keys</a></h3>
<p>A private key is essentially a string of digital characters that can generate a public key, which can go through hashing to form addresses. The introduction of Cryptocurrency initiated with users being in complete control without relying on an external entity (being your bank). This automatically means user is responsible for his own funds, and it is an individual's responsibility to keep this private key(s) safe and secure. If you lose your private keys, you essentially lose your access to digital funds on blockchain, and no one (not even developers) can get your access back.</p>
<p>The best practices for securing your private key depend on individual's usage of his device. There isnt a golden rule that applies to all. In the current age, having keys online is often susceptible to vulnerabilities - be it security of your online device, or access to physical servers. Thus, a common good practice is having your private keys offline from a digitial media. You dont want any form of unencrypted or easily brute forcable format of private key on your online device.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#heirarchical-deterministic-hd-wallets" id="heirarchical-deterministic-hd-wallets">Heirarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets</a></h3>
<p>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets allow users to derive keys (private and public) from a common seed (mnemonics) that are easier to backup and allow better wallet features and privacy of history. This means you may receive a combination of words (12, 15, 24, 25 or 27 - dependening on type of wallet software you elect) and the hash of these words actually result in your unique private key, making it easier for access and security. One of the features of a HD wallet is that a single wallet can hold up to 2147483647 accounts with 2147483647 addresses, all associated to a single wallet - and each with its own unique history of transaction records.</p>
<p>You can visit <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/wiki/About-Address-Derivation">this wiki</a> for detailed information about HD Wallets and how address derivation works between HD Random (Legacy Byron Daedalus wallets - where addresses start with Ddz..) and HD Sequential (Yoroi Wallets - where Addresses start with Ae2..) on current mainnet.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#funds-in-a-wallet-versus-address" id="funds-in-a-wallet-versus-address">Funds in a wallet versus address</a></h3>
<p>One of the common confusions users encounter is reading balance of a HD Wallet, and conflicting funds in an address versus funds in a wallet. This is because of the way UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) HD Wallets operate. Every new transaction within a wallet automatically selects a set of addresses that form a minimum balance to make the transfer, and then adds a <em>new</em> output address (referred to as UTXO above) - which is a &quot;change address&quot;.
The concept is best explained by using an analogy with currency notes - as used in current financial system.</p>
<p>Let us consider Alice has 3 notes of 10 dollars each in her purse, and wants to buy 50 apples from Bob at a cost of 18 dollars.
Alice pays using both 10 dollar notes to Bob , and receives a change of 2 dollars (which she did not have before) as a new unspent output of this transaction.
Thus, Alice, now ends up with a 10 dollar note and a 2 dollar change - added to her purse. Checking her purse for old notes, will result in a 10 dollar note - but overall funds in her purse will also include that additional 2 dollar change.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you make a transaction from a wallet - the inputs selected will often exceed the output and a change will have to be created.
When querying funds, if you're looking at value of an address - you may not see the complete picture, because wallet is made up of many addresses, and users may not know which address has how much funds after making transactions.
Thus, best way to query your funds is using your wallet software , which had access to your keys. While to look at whether funds have reached to address B, explorer comes in handy.</p>
<p>For further details, you can read the excellent <a href="https://emurgo.io/en/blog/blockchain-primer-cardanos-utxo-model-simply-explained">blog from Emurgo</a> which goes into moredetails about UTXO model.</p>

Every new transaction within a wallet automatically selects a set of addresses that form a minimum balance to make the transfer, and then adds a <em>new</em> output address (referred to as UTXO above) - which is a &quot;change address&quot;.
The concept is best explained by using an analogy with currency notes - as used in current financial system.</p>
<p>Let us consider Alice has 3 notes of 10 dollars each in her purse, and wants to buy 50 apples from Bob at a cost of 18 dollars.
Alice pays using both 10 dollar notes to Bob , and receives a change of 2 dollars (which she did not have before) as a new unspent output of this transaction.
Thus, Alice, now ends up with a 10 dollar note and a 2 dollar change - added to her purse. Checking her purse for old notes, will result in a 10 dollar note - but overall funds in her purse will also include that additional 2 dollar change.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you make a transaction from a wallet - the inputs selected will often exceed the output and a change will have to be created.
When querying funds, if you're looking at value of an address - you may not see the complete picture, because wallet is made up of many addresses, and users may not know which address has how much funds after making transactions.
Thus, best way to query your funds is using your wallet software , which had access to your keys. While to look at whether funds have reached to address B, explorer comes in handy.</p>
<p>For further details, you can read the excellent <a href="https://emurgo.io/en/blog/blockchain-primer-cardanos-utxo-model-simply-explained">blog from Emurgo</a> which goes into moredetails about UTXO model.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#types-of-wallets" id="types-of-wallets">Types of Wallets</a></h2>
<p>Now that you have familiarised with what wallet is technically, lets explore the types of wallets you can use. Please navigate as per below to explore specific type of wallet.</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="Wallets/types.html#full-node-wallet">Full-Node Wallets</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="Wallets/types.html#hardware-wallets">Hardware Wallets</a></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarise from end user's point of view, there are primarily two types of wallet:</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#software-wallets" id="software-wallets">Software Wallets:</a></h3>
<p>A software wallet is a digital wallet interface where the cryptographic keys (encrypted) will be stored on the device you're using. Within software wallets, there are mainly two types of wallets as noted below.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#full-node-wallet" id="full-node-wallet">Full node wallet:</a></h4>
<p>A full node wallet runs a complete independent blockchain node and provides capability to operate your wallet by querying the node. An example of such a wallet is Daedalus. There are a few advantages of running such a node:</p>
<ul>
<li>The entire blockchain history is available locally to your node, to be able to query as per your needs.</li>
<li>Your node will validate all blocks as they're created and synchronised to your device, thereby - reducing the trust required to operate on wallet.</li>
<li>Running a full node - also enhances availability of the blockchain in your geograpical region, providing better latency for block making nodes.</li>
<li>If there is a feature supported by node, but not yet by a wallet UI - you can directly connect to the node and access the feature.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alongwith those advantages, running a node automatically means a few responsibilities - which may be seen as a discomfor from end user's perspective - especially if your only usage is making transactions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Synching entire blockchain on your device needs time when setting up initially, which could be hours depending on network and disk throughput of the device.</li>
<li>There are storage, memory and network commitments required to run a wallet connected to full node.</li>
<li>Full node wallets may not be considered ideal for portable/handheld devices.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="header" href="#light-wallet" id="light-wallet">Light wallet:</a></h4>
<p>A light wallet is a light-weight interface that connects to a remote node for operations - thus, relieving you of the responsibility to operate a full blockchain node. An example of such a wallet is Yoroi. Advantages of using light wallet:</p>
<ul>
<li>You do not need to wait for entire blockchain to be synched on your device to start performing operations, as you connect to an already running up-to-date node via your wallet.</li>
<li>You remain in control of your keys. A common misperception with light wallets is that it is unsafe because your keys are sent over network. Most professional light wallets will ensure that your keys never leave your device, and are always in encrypted state even on your device. To this point, this shouldnt really be a differentiator for you to select between a full node wallet v/s light wallet, they're <em>both as safe as your device.</em></li>
<li>You do not need to worry about performing blockchain node upgrades, as this can be done on the server end.</li>
<li>Light wallets can be integrated easily on portable/handle devices.</li>
<li>They're typically very lightweight, and do not have high storage/memory or stable network requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-explorer" id="what-is-an-explorer">What is an Explorer?</a></h3>
<p>An explorer is a web based graphical tool, used to search for and view information stored on the blockchain ledger.</p>
<p>When users interact with the Cardano network, whether that is by sending and receiving ada or delegating to a stake pool, these interactions are broadcast to the network in the form of transactions. A block producing node takes a number of these transactions, verifies their validity and then adds them to the tip of the chain in a new block.</p>
<p>Blockchain explorers allow users to view these blocks and the included transactions, in addition to supplementary metadata. They present this data in a format that is human readable and accessible using a web browser.</p>
<p>Cardano explorers commonly provide the following information:<br />
Epoch number<br />
Slot number<br />
Block number<br />
Transaction hashes<br />
Input and output values<br />
Timestamp<br />
Block producing node identifier</p>
<p>Some explorers provide additional tools and information, such as API support, a list of the largest addresses by ada balance, and graphical visualisations of the blockchain's network activity.</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#selecting-a-stake-pool-to-delegate-with" id="selecting-a-stake-pool-to-delegate-with">Selecting a Stake Pool to delegate with</a></h3>
<p>There is no 1-for-all pool that you can delegate with, otherwise - every one would be delegating to same pool and there wouldnt be a point of decentralisation :) . While many users are attracted to the pool with lowest fee margins, it is usually the least important factor to distinguish between stake pools. Below are a few factors that might be important to take into consideration.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Remember, you - a delegator - are indirectly one of the core components of the protocol and your actions may determine the decentralisation as well as adoption of the platform. Whether it is for your benefit, or benefit of the network - it is important that you select carefully who you will be delegating to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this section we will discuss the different aspects that users should consider when selecting who they would like to support. If you're unsure about any of the parameters when simply using wallet, please leverage benefits of community platforms built to help you with the decision making. The platforms are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://pooltool.io">Pooltool</a></li>
<li><a href="https://adapools.org">ADAPools</a></li>
<li><a href="https://pegasuspool.info/explorer">Pegasus</a></li>
<li><a href="http://cardanoscan.io">CardanoScan</a>
Most of these sites will allow you to filter using various parameters to help you with the decision making. Furthermore, note the points below:</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="header" href="#saturation-point" id="saturation-point">Saturation Point</a></h4>
<p>In order to not centralise all stake delegation to a single pool, after reaching a certain delegation criteria (calculated by <code>Total Supply in Circulation</code>/<code>nOpt</code>) where nOpt is currently 150, a pool will no longer be getting higher rewards for more delegation. Thus, the reward portion of individual delegator will start reducing further as more stake is delegated to such a pool.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#amount-of-stake-against-a-pool" id="amount-of-stake-against-a-pool">Amount of Stake against a pool</a></h4>
<p>A Proof of Stake protocol allots more blocks to pools who have higher stake, until reaching the <code>saturation point</code>. Thus, if you're delegating to a pool with almost no stake - unless you are delegating a few millions, the chances for that pool to make blocks will be less - and you may not earn much rewards. At the same time, note that the higher the stake, the ratio of your stake to tota delegated stake against the pool will become smaller - and so will the rewards you earn. Ideally you would want to be somewhere between 3% to 60% of stake of saturation point so that you're delegated to a pool who is making blocks consistently as well as you're not losing out on rewards ratio.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#the-pool-operator" id="the-pool-operator">The Pool Operator</a></h4>
<p>When staking with a pool, the first and foremost think you'd want to know about is the pool operator and his/her presence in the community. When things go south, you should be able to get in touch with the owners/operators of the pool. Most of the pools out there will have their social links available either via the website associated with the pool, or via extended metadata information. While we cannot judge everyone who wishes to not disclose their identities, you can be certain that ones who have been around for a while will not be putting their reputation at risk.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#number-of-pools-run-by-operator" id="number-of-pools-run-by-operator">Number of pools run by operator</a></h4>
<p>There are a few operators running multiple pools with attractive marketing of low fees and very low pledge. While they're completely within their rights to do so - as allowed by the protocol, it is something controversial - and the aesthetics of such a pool is questionable. What such pools are doing (perhaps unintentionally) is a start of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil_attack#:%7E:text=In%20a%20Sybil%20attack%2C%20the,diagnosed%20with%20dissociative%20identity%20disorder">Sybil attack</a> on the protocol. The protocol is designed to have incentives against this behaviour, but it only works on <em>basic rational of delegator</em> being careful to not to make such pools too powerful.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#update-channels" id="update-channels">Update channels</a></h4>
<p>More often than not, Pool Operators will add ways to subscribe to their channels (be it telegram groups or twitter feed or website). It is important to join these channels for things like change of pledge amount or fees. Not doing so may leave a feeling of being blindsided when seeing a change of pool parameters. If you cannot find a way to reach the operator, you might want to question your decision.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#wallet-ranking" id="wallet-ranking">Wallet Ranking</a></h4>
<p>Wallet ranking in absence of any history on chain will be a bit random. Same pool showing up as rank # 1 on one machine might show up as rank 700 on other. <strong>After initial few epochs on Shelley</strong>, Official wallets (Daedalus/Yoroi) will have some data accumulated to help you make decisions based on few factors. While this should not be followed blindly, but this would be a good reference point for delegators to see how desirable the pool is as per the original specifications of the wallets.</p>
<h4><a class="header" href="#fees" id="fees">Fees</a></h4>
<p>There are a few fee parameters that you see associated with a pool that people like to take into consideration:</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#pool-pledge" id="pool-pledge">Pool Pledge</a></h5>
<p>Pledge is basically the promise from the owners of a pool to maintain in their owner keys of the pool (thus , their own &quot;skin-in-the-game&quot;). Higher amount of pledge is rewarded by higher amount of rewards. However, note that at the current protocol parameters, the overall difference for rewards is not hugely affected by a pool pledging 100K vs pool pledging 1M (eg: for base assumptions, delegating 100K towards 100K pledged pool might earn you 5159 v/s 1M pledged pool might earn you 5161 ADA annually. However, delegating with 10M pledged pool for same assumptions might earn you 5223 ADA for the same scenario over a year. You can play with pledge parameter and their effects using the IOHK staking calculator <a href="https://testnets.cardano.org/en/cardano/tools/staking-calculator/">here</a></p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#pool-fixed-costs" id="pool-fixed-costs">Pool Fixed costs</a></h5>
<p>This is the minimum rewards a pool will earn before rewards against blocks made by a specific pool is distributed to its delegators by the protocol. Current protocol parameters dictate a minimum of 340 ADA as a fixed minimum cost. The fee is enforced to prevent a race to 0 fee pools that are not really sustainable for protocol in future. Note that this the fixed cost from entire reward pot against all delegators delegating to pool.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#pool-margin-" id="pool-margin-">Pool Margin (%)</a></h5>
<p>This is the percentage of rewards that a pool will be able to make from the total rewards pot. As compared to the reward pot that a pool generates (eg: 10000 ADA), the delegator's margin (eg: 2.5% of total rewards from pool) is not hugely affected by the Pool's margin being 1% (i.e. 230.9 ADA) v/s 4% (224.9 ADA) does not really affect delegator's rewards by a very big margin, unless that delegator forms a substantial amount of stake for that pool. The rewards are affected by lottery of slot allotment and pool's performance a lot more than the difference of margin.</p>
<h5><a class="header" href="#performance" id="performance">Performance</a></h5>
<p>This is an estimate of pool's performance based on how much stake protocol <em>thinks</em> a pool would have made versus how much pool actually did. Every block is rewarded by protocol (until saturation point), thus a delegator would want to stick with a pool that has greater than 80-85% of performance. Note that we cannot conclusively say 100% here because the actual blocks made by pools will also depend on how much blocks were actually assigned to a pool. There is a bit of randomness involved here for blocks to be assigned, which is proportional (like a roulette reserving higher number of slots corresponding) to stake.</p>
<p>Hope the above helps you pick up a pool of your choice. If you would like to see any additions to this list, please raise an issue/PR against this repo using the icon on top right corner of the page.</p>
<h2><a class="header" href="#how-to-identify-a-scam" id="how-to-identify-a-scam">How to identify a SCAM</a></h2>
<p>We commonly come across users losing their moneys to various giveaways or impersonators. Being in a decentralised cryptocurrency means you as an individual are your own bank, and only you are responsible for protecting your funds.
If you fall for any of these and you giveaway funds or share your private keys, <strong>nobody</strong> can recover your funds. Do your due diligence when operating your crypto, just as you would when operating fiat currency notes.
Also, if you come across such a scam, please forward the messages or group information to <a href="https://t.me/CardanoReportToAdmin">Cardano Report To Admin</a> group on telegram.
Note to telegram users, we cannot do much if you forward a screenshot, please ensure you select the message from the scammer and <code>forward</code> it to group mentioned above.</p>
<p>Below is a list of common Gotchas to be aware of for common scam practices and ways to be safe:</p>
<details>
<Summary>Free Giveaways/Promotion</Summary>
<p><em>&quot;If it is looks too good to be true, it probably is&quot;</em></p>
<p>Often users get pulled into promotional scams promising great returns. Beware of such promotions, there are no free moneys to simply grab online.
This is a very common scamming method targetted towards users who are new to the digital financial ecosystem.</p>
<p>While the above is true for any platform, telegram is one of the most commonly exploited avenues for such scam operations. if you get added to such a group, please <a href="https://t.me/CardanoReportToAdmin">inform officials</a>, and click the &quot;Report Spam and Leave&quot; option. Usually you would often also see a lot of users responding with confirmations to those Giveaway scams - these are mostly bot accounts, do not fall for them.
Checkout a typical giveaway scam and fake user responses below:</p>

<details>
<Summary>Receiving DM from someone impersonating admins/ambassadors</Summary>
<p>One other common scamming practice you often see on telegram is accounts trying to impersonate official accounts or personnels (admins/ambassadors).</p>
<p><strong>As an alert, be sure that none of the official admins/ambassadors will message you directly.</strong></p>
<p>These types of scams are pretty easy to identify yourself if you pay attention to details:</p>
<ul>
<li>You would often notice you do not share common groups with the scammers. The moderators from the official channels are diligent and actively try to keep impersonators at bay. But there are often proxy accounts hidden in groups which share and allow impersonating accounts to message users.<br />
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/support-faq/images/docs/images/tg-impersonator-check-1.jpg" alt="Check Common groups" /></li>
<li>They may mask the usernames to be similar (eg: <code>rd1rt</code> instead of <code>rdlrt</code>) or they may hide Username and add <code>@rdlrt</code> text to Bio instead. Please be on the lookout for such methods and verify Username <em>as well as</em> Bio when chatting with anyone in DMs.<br />

</ul>
</details>
<details>
<Summary>Being added to a random group/channel(s)</Summary>
<p>Very often telegram users are added to a scam group that looks legit (see screenshot below). The content of the group may be promotional as above or try to push in a scam link within group of correct ones. If you're not sure if you jo
ined that group, please cross-check the list of <a href="https://t.me/Cardano/271989">community groups on telegram</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cardano-community/support-faq/images/docs/images/random-impersonating-groups.jpg" alt="Random Impersonating groups" /></p>
<p>To prevent getting added to such groups, please ensure your user settings in telegram is updated as below:</p>

<details>
<Summary>Receiving DM from unknown users</Summary>
<p>One of the more common and amateur scam attempts would be scammers with fake user profiles (often using a model or an investor's photo in profile) will message you directly, and after a friendly conversation ask you either for assistance with stuck funds (asking you to share some funds to unlock theirs) or giving investment expert recommendations (often to a scam exchange/website). Simply forward the message to the admin group mentioned earlier, and report such users to telegram as spam. Few examples of such scam conversations below:</p>

<h3><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-wallet-2" id="what-is-a-wallet-2">What is a Wallet?</a></h3>
<p>A wallet is essentially a software that grants users access to the funds on blockchain using their private keys. You can use different wallets, but as long as you're using same private key - you would have access to the same funds on blockchain. Wallets in cardano ecosystem are of <em>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD)</em> and based on <em>UTXO</em> - and for good reasons. Before diving into these terms, lets ensure the basics about Private keys and its security is clarified.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#basics-about-private-keys-2" id="basics-about-private-keys-2">Basics about Private keys</a></h3>
<p>A private key is essentially a string of digital characters that can generate a public key, which can go through hashing to form addresses. The introduction of Cryptocurrency initiated with users being in complete control without relying on an external entity (being your bank). This automatically means user is responsible for his own funds, and it is an individual's responsibility to keep this private key(s) safe and secure. If you lose your private keys, you essentially lose your access to digital funds on blockchain, and no one (not even developers) can get your access back.</p>
<p>The best practices for securing your private key depend on individual's usage of his device. There isnt a golden rule that applies to all. In the current age, having keys online is often susceptible to vulnerabilities - be it security of your online device, or access to physical servers. Thus, a common good practice is having your private keys offline from a digitial media. You dont want any form of unencrypted or easily brute forcable format of private key on your online device.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#heirarchical-deterministic-hd-wallets-2" id="heirarchical-deterministic-hd-wallets-2">Heirarchical Deterministic (HD) Wallets</a></h3>
<p>Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets allow users to derive keys (private and public) from a common seed (mnemonics) that are easier to backup and allow better wallet features and privacy of history. This means you may receive a combination of words (12, 15, 24, 25 or 27 - dependening on type of wallet software you elect) and the hash of these words actually result in your unique private key, making it easier for access and security. One of the features of a HD wallet is that a single wallet can hold up to 2147483647 accounts with 2147483647 addresses, all associated to a single wallet - and each with its own unique history of transaction records.</p>
<p>You can visit <a href="https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-wallet/wiki/About-Address-Derivation">this wiki</a> for detailed information about HD Wallets and how address derivation works between HD Random (Legacy Byron Daedalus wallets - where addresses start with Ddz..) and HD Sequential (Yoroi Wallets - where Addresses start with Ae2..) on current mainnet.</p>
<h3><a class="header" href="#funds-in-a-wallet-versus-address-2" id="funds-in-a-wallet-versus-address-2">Funds in a wallet versus address</a></h3>
<p>One of the common confusions users encounter is reading balance of a HD Wallet, and conflicting funds in an address versus funds in a wallet. This is because of the way UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) HD Wallets operate. Every new transaction within a wallet automatically selects a set of addresses that form a minimum balance to make the transfer, and then adds a <em>new</em> output address (referred to as UTXO above) - which is a &quot;change address&quot;.
The concept is best explained by using an analogy with currency notes - as used in current financial system.</p>
<p>Let us consider Alice has 3 notes of 10 dollars each in her purse, and wants to buy 50 apples from Bob at a cost of 18 dollars.
Alice pays using both 10 dollar notes to Bob , and receives a change of 2 dollars (which she did not have before) as a new unspent output of this transaction.
Thus, Alice, now ends up with a 10 dollar note and a 2 dollar change - added to her purse. Checking her purse for old notes, will result in a 10 dollar note - but overall funds in her purse will also include that additional 2 dollar change.</p>
<p>Similarly, when you make a transaction from a wallet - the inputs selected will often exceed the output and a change will have to be created.
When querying funds, if you're looking at value of an address - you may not see the complete picture, because wallet is made up of many addresses, and users may not know which address has how much funds after making transactions.
Thus, best way to query your funds is using your wallet software , which had access to your keys. While to look at whether funds have reached to address B, explorer comes in handy.</p>
<p>For further details, you can read the excellent <a href="https://emurgo.io/en/blog/blockchain-primer-cardanos-utxo-model-simply-explained">blog from Emurgo</a> which goes into moredetails about UTXO model.</p>
